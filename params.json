Goal would be to implement tools for solving most common computer vision problems - various image processing tasks, feature detection and tracking, camera calibration, stereo etc.\r\n\r\n## Library Modules\r\n* core - Core structures and algorithms (mainly relying on std.experimental.ndslice);\r\n* imgproc - Image processing tasks;\r\n* io - Input/Output support for different image and video formats;\r\n* plot - Ploting module, showing images, videos, basic 2D shape drawing etc;\r\n* tracking - video tracking module - optical flow and other related methods;\r\n* features - Feature detection, description and matching module;\r\n* multiview - Multiview geometry module, camera calibration, stereo, reconstruction etc.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nLibrary is licensed under Boost Software License - Version 1.0. Some modules in the library contain code that is licensed under some other terms. If a module in the library states different license terms in it's header, then the Boost Software License does not apply to that module.\r\n\r\n",
